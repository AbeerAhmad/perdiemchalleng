## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Installation 

```bash
# using npm
npm install 

cd ios 

bundle install 

pod install 
cd ..
```
## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:
### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

### For Logins with email

```bash
# using npm
email 
test@gmail.com

password
123455678

```
